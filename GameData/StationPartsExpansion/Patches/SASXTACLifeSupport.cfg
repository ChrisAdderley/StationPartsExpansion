// TAC Life Support patch for STATION PARTS EXPANSION
// For use with TAC-LS and STATION PARTS EXPANSION v0.4.0 by Nertea

// Author: Ryan Montieth Gill
// Cribbed from SDHI Service Module System MM Patch by the illustrious Robin "sumghai" Chang
// Revision: 0.1
//

// This modifies the various habitable Modules of the SSPX package for a number of days of life support supplies for the standard complement of Kerbals of that sort of module. The other modules which are set aside for storage have added resources as they presumptively have storage in various parts as squirreled away. 
//
// Modules with Long Term habitation have 48 days base food and solid waste storage. Short term Habitation will have 24 days of base food solid waste storage. 
// Higher crew densities will require added storage space for resources but without corresponding use of the space for actual inhabitants. 
// Station core modules will have basic supplies of water and O2 with storage capacity and  processors for CO2 and water purification as well as electrolysis. High density hab modules will have added CO2 and water purification functionality. 
//
// Thus with long term habitation, ~4 modules gives 4 kerbals 100+ days of Food Consumables and a smaller portion of O2/Water supplies assuming there is no recycling system. 
//
// This is based on the max known period of time for the ISS to have been for supply duration during Space Shuttle launch holds (due to the loss of the Columbia) 128 days but with a large number of modules for total storage for a small crew size. 
//
//

// Numbers here were a based on details from Sumghai’s work on his MM Config file and some extrapolation and Wild ass guesses on my part. // 
// If you don’t like it please let me know. Feel free to tweak if you so wish.
