    #LOC_SSPX_crewpod-cupola-375_description = If you're looking for a great set of narrow-angle windows for your space station, Kerbalmax has you covered. The PXL-9 has twelve. It seats several Kerbals and includes rudimentary spacecraft controls.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewpod-habitation-25_description = Though the venerable Hitchhiker gives us a place to store Kerbals on-orbit, a longer module can store them for even longer. Please note that the beds are purely decorative and sleeping in them is not an intended function.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewpod-habitation-375_description = This giant tin can includes facilities for sleeping, snacking and seating. It is one of the first spacecraft components to feature Separate Pressurized Compartments (patent pending). Its thick walls and insulation might make it a great interplanetary habitat.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-hub-25_description = Though the primary appeal of the Distributor lies in its bargain-bin price tag, it does make a very serviceable central hub for surface or space structures, as it contains a remote guidance unit and potent reaction wheels.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-25-375-1_title = PXL-2 Pressurized Conical Storage Container
    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-25-375-1_description = The aerodynamic shape of this adapter piece should make up for its lack of any structural reinforcement at all if operated in atmosphere, though it doesn't make up for the large mass. Luckily for us, we can cram some Kerbals inside. Unluckily for them, we couldn't afford seatbelts.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-125-1_title = PTD-02 Pressurized Crew Tube
    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-125-1_description = The PTD-01 was so popular that Kerbalmax created the half-length PTD-02 to satisfy demands for more parts. It's a pity they're charging somewhat more than would be expected, especially since the cut lines are still visible.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-airlock-125_description = After several incidents where unsuspecting Kerbalnauts unwittingly vented entire Hitchhiker pods to vacuum, engineers at Kerbalmax devised the Self-Contained Air Transport Tube for Excursion Rehearsal, which solves the problem by putting a second door between crew and space. It has seen limited uptake.

    #LOC_SSPX_crewtube-hub-125_description = Kerbalmax's lower-tier station core product also contains a guidance unit and reaction wheels, though neither of these are particularly efficient or capable. Great for the budget space program.
